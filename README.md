- [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap)

## Setting up the app

After cloning the repo use `yarn` to install dependencies.

The app needs a `.env` file with the following variables:

`NODE_ENV=xxxxx`<br>
`PORT=xxxxxx`<br>
`GOOGLE_EMAIL_FROM=xxxxx`<br>
`GOOGLE_EMAIL_PASSWORD=xxxxx`<br>
`GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=xxxxx`<br>

To use Google Calendar API from nodejs server, you'll need a service account and service account key that can be created in Google Developers Console.
